# The abiotic environment

The abiotic component of the Virtual Ecosystem focuses on non-living environmental
factors that influence ecosystem dynamics. These factors encompass
[microclimate](./microclimate_theory.md) and [hydrology](./microclimate_theory.md)
processes, which are critical for understanding and predicting ecological
responses of organisms to various environmental conditions, interactions between
organisms that shape communities, and the geographical distribution of species.
