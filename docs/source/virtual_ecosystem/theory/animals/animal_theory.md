# Theory of the animals

This is a high level landing page from animal theory, that will be filled out at a later
date.

Both animal carcasses and excrement are important resources for animals to scavenge
from, as such their decay is tracked as part of the animal model. How they are tracked
is explained [here](./carcasses_and_excrement.md).
