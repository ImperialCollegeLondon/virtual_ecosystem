# Theory of litter decay

## Litter pools

We also select our litter pools from a pre-existing framework
{cite}`kirschbaum_modelling_2002`. Here, pools are principally defined by input type,
e.g. coarse wood, fine wood, structural and metabolic. They are then further subdivided
into above- and below-ground pools. Some of these pools cannot be fully characterised
due to insufficient data and so following {cite}`fatichi_mechanistic_2019`, we neglect
them. This means that we use a single above-ground woody litter pool, rather than coarse
and fine woody, and we do not include any below-ground woody pool. This leaves us with
the following pools

### Above-ground metabolic litter

Above-ground metabolic litter can originate as any non-woody above-ground plant matter
(e.g. bark, leaves, fruit, etc). By definition the pool contains plant matter that is
easily broken down, i.e. that with low lignin concentration.

### Above-ground structural litter

High lignin concentration biomass from leaves etc is instead included in the
above-ground structural litter pool. This pool shares a set of sources with the
metabolic pool, and the split between them in determined based on the lignin:N ratio of
the input.

### Above-ground woody litter

Above-ground dead wood is treated separately due to its substantially different turnover
dynamics. So all wood losses from tree falls, branch fall etc, is assumed to be added to
an above-ground woody pool.

### Below-ground metabolic litter

For the below-ground pools roots (both fine and coarse) are the major source of biomass.
We make the assumption that coarse root debris fragments sufficiently to not need to be
captured in a separate woody pool. The below-ground metabolic litter pool then includes
the easily broken down root debris.

### Below-ground structural litter

As with the above-ground case the fraction of dead root biomass that ends up in the
below-ground structural pool is set by the lignin:N ratio of the input.
