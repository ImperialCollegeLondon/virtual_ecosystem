## Definition

In the context of the Virtual Ecosystem, hydrology is defined as the distribution and
movement of water both on and below the Earth's surface as well as through organisms.

Water is crucial in an ecosystem for several reasons. It is essential for the survival
of all living organisms, providing the medium for biochemical reactions and cellular
processes. Further, water plays a key role in many ecosystem processes such as
photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, and the decomposition of organic matter. Water facilitates
the movement of nutrients and minerals within the soil which enables plant growth and
maintains soil health. Aquatic environments, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands, provide
habitats for a wide range of species which supports biodiversity. Additionally, water
bodies influence microclimates by regulating temperatures through heat
absorption and release.

## Factors affecting hydrology

The hydrology on an ecosystem is mostly determined by macro- and microclimate,
topography, soil and geology, vegetation type and structure, and human activities such
as land use change.

### Climate

* **Precipitation**: The amount, timing, and type of precipitation (rain, snow, etc.)
directly influence water availability and flow patterns.
* **Temperature**: Temperature affects evaporation rates and the amount of water that
plants and soil can retain.
* **Evapotranspiration**: The combined process of evaporation and transpiration affects
water loss from the surface to the atmosphere.

### Topography

* **Slope**: The steepness of the terrain affects how quickly water runs off the surface
and infiltrates the soil.
* **Elevation**: Higher elevations tend to receive more precipitation, which impacts
water flow and distribution.
* **Landforms**: Natural features such as mountains, valleys, and plains influence the
direction and speed of water movement.

### Soil and Geology

* **Soil type**: Different soil types (sand, clay, loam) have varying capacities to retain
and filter water.
* **Permeability**: The ability of soil and rock to absorb and transmit water affects
groundwater recharge and surface runoff.
* **Rock formations**: The composition and structure of underlying rock formations influence
groundwater storage and flow.

### Vegetation

* **Plant types**: Different species of plants have varying water needs and capacities
to absorb and transpire water.
* **Density**: Dense vegetation can slow down surface runoff, enhance infiltration, and
reduce soil erosion.
* **Root systems**: Deep and extensive root systems can increase soil stability and
improve water infiltration and retention.

### Human activities

* **Deforestation**: Removing trees and vegetation decreases transpiration, increases runoff,
and contributes to soil erosion.
* **Agriculture**: Irrigation, crop type, and farming practices influence water usage,
runoff, and infiltration.
* **Water management practices**: Dams, reservoirs, and water diversion projects impact the
natural distribution and availability of water.
* **Urbanization**: Development and construction alter natural water flow, increase surface
runoff, and reduce infiltration.

## Key hydrological variables and processes

### Local water balance

The local water balance is, similar to the microclimate, driven by large scale hydrological
patterns and affects the living conditions for organisms at the local scale.
The local water balance can be represented by the equation:

$$\Delta S = P − ET − R$$ (water_balance)

where $\Delta S$ represents the net change in water stored in the system, $P$ stands
for precipitation, the total water input, $ET$ is the evapotranspiration with accounts
for water loss to the atmosphere, and runoff $R$ represents water that flows out of
the system.

The water balance include above and below ground processes that together describe the
flow of water through the system:

#### Above ground

* **Precipitation**: This includes all forms of water input from the atmosphere, such as
rain, snow, sleet, and hail. The quantity and frequency of precipitation directly affect
the amount of water entering the local system.
* **Intercept**: Some precipitation is caught and held by plant leaves, branches, and
stems before it reaches the ground. This intercepted water can either evaporate back into
the atmosphere or eventually drip to the soil.
* **Evapotranspiration**: Evaporation describes the process where water is converted
from liquid to vapor and released into the atmosphere from surfaces like soil, water
bodies, and vegetation. Transpiration rferns to the release of water vapor from plants
into the atmosphere through small openings in their leaves called stomata.
Combined, these processes account for water loss from the surface and vegetation to the
atmosphere.

* **Surface runoff**: The portion of precipitation that flows over the land surface
toward streams, rivers, and other water bodies. Runoff is influenced by factors such as
land slope, soil saturation, and land use. High runoff can lead to erosion and nutrient
loss.

#### Below ground

* **Infiltration**: The process where water on the ground surface enters the soil.
Infiltration rates depend on soil type, soil moisture, land cover, and land management
practices. Enhanced infiltration reduces surface runoff and recharges groundwater.
* **Bypass flow**: Some of the water that infiltarted into the soil bypasses the soil
matrix and drains directly to the groundwater, for example through soil pipes.  
* **Groundwater flow**: Water that infiltrates the soil can percolate down to recharge
groundwater aquifers. Groundwater flow contributes to maintaining base flow in rivers
and streams during dry periods. The rate of groundwater flow is determined by the
permeability of subsurface materials and the hydraulic gradient.
* **Storage changes**: Water storage can occur in various forms such as soil moisture,
surface water bodies (lakes, reservoirs), and groundwater. Changes in storage are
influenced by the balance between inputs (precipitation) and outputs (evapotranspiration,
runoff, groundwater flow).
* **Root water uptake**: A fraction of soil water is extracted by plants. On average,
the amount of water extracted from soil is approximately the same as transpiration rates.

### Catchment scale water balance

At catchment scale, horizontal movement and distribution is considered. This includes
above and below ground flow of water.

* **Surface runoff and surface water flow**: Runoff represents the portion of precipitation
that flows over the land surface and into streams, rivers, and lakes. Surface water flow
dynamics are influenced by topography, soil characteristics, land cover, and human
activities.
* **Groundwater Flow and Storage**: Water that infiltrates the soil can move horizontally
through aquifers, contributing to groundwater storage. Horizontal groundwater flow
interacts with surface water bodies, influencing base flow in rivers and streams.

## Links to the biotic components

Understanding the interactions between hydrology and biota is essential for ecosystem
management, conservation efforts, and predicting the impacts of environmental changes
on water resources and biodiversity.

* **Vegetation and transpiration**: Vegetation plays a critical role in the hydrological
cycle by influencing water uptake and transpiration rates. Plant roots absorb water from
the soil, which is then released into the atmosphere through transpiration, affecting
local humidity and precipitation patterns.

* **Influence on soil moisture**: The presence and density of vegetation affect soil
moisture levels through interception of rainfall and shading of the ground surface.
Changes in vegetation cover can impact soil infiltration rates and runoff, altering
local water availability and flow dynamics.

* **Biotic nutrient cycling**: Biota such as microbes and plants participate in nutrient
cycling, affecting soil fertility and water quality. Nutrient uptake by vegetation and
subsequent decomposition of organic matter influence nutrient concentrations in surface
and groundwater.

* **Ecosystem services**: Riparian vegetation along water bodies provides habitat and
stabilizes streambanks, reducing erosion and sediment transport. Wetlands act as natural
filters, improving water quality by trapping sediments and absorbing nutrients before
water enters larger water bodies.

* **Feedbacks and adaptations**: Biota within aquatic ecosystems adapt to hydrological
changes, influencing community structure and biodiversity. In turn, changes in biotic
composition can feedback to alter water flow patterns and nutrient dynamics within the
ecosystem.

research. A review on the progress and future of hydrological modelling is given by
{cite:t}`singh_hydrologic_2018`.

### Data collection

Effective hydrology modelling relies on accurate data collection, ideally from a
combination of sources:

* **Meteorological stations**: Meteorological stations provide detailed, real-time data
on precipitation, humidity, and sometime soil moisture for locations across an area.
Data collection instruments include rain gauges, stream gauges, and soil moisture sensors.
* **Remote sensing**: Satellite imagery and aerial surveys provide spatial and temporal
data on precipitation patterns, land cover, and surface water dynamics.
* **In-situ measurements**: Ground-based sensors complement provide high-resolution data
on specific local conditions.
* **Reanalysis**: Reanalysis data sets such as ERA5 represent a combination of observations
and modelling which can complement measurements by filling gaps in spatial cover and
timeseries.

### Hydrology modelling

Hydrology models employ diverse methodologies to simulate the movement and distribution
of water within natural systems.

### Models

* **Rainfall-Runoff models** simulate the transformation of precipitation into runoff,
accounting for factors like soil infiltration, evapotranspiration, and land cover
characteristics.
* **Groundwater flow models** utilize principles of fluid mechanics to simulate the
movement of water through subsurface aquifers, considering geologic properties,
recharge rates, and extraction activities.
* **Integrated watershed models** combine surface water and groundwater components to
provide a comprehensive view of water resources within a watershed, facilitating watershed
management and land use planning decisions.

### Tools and techniques

* **Modeling tools** include Geographic Information Systems (GIS), statistical software,
and specialized hydrological modeling platforms.
* **Techniques** such as data assimilation, uncertainty analysis, and scenario testing help
improve model accuracy and reliability.

### Applications

* Hydrological models are used for flood forecasting, water resource management,
drought assessment, and climate change impact studies.
* They support decision-making in agriculture, urban planning, and environmental
conservation by predicting water availability and mitigating risks.

## Challenges and limitations

* **Data scarcity and quality**: Limited availability of hydrological data in certain
regions hinders accurate modeling and forecasting. Data quality issues, such as
measurement errors or inconsistencies, can affect model reliability and decision outcomes.

* **Complexity of natural systems**: Natural variability and non-linear interactions in
hydrological processes pose challenges for model representation and prediction.
Incorporating spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics requires advanced modeling
techniques and computational resources.

* **Uncertainty and assumptions**: Uncertainty in model parameters, input data, and future
climate projections affects the reliability of hydrological predictions.
Assumptions made in model development and simplifications of complex processes can
introduce biases and uncertainties.

* **Human and environmental disturbance**: Anthropogenic activities such as land use
change, urbanization, and water infrastructure development alter hydrological patterns.
Environmental changes, including deforestation, climate variability, and extreme weather
events, challenge the resilience of hydrological systems.

* **Interdisciplinary integration**: Effective integration of hydrological modeling with
other disciplines such as ecology, economics, and policy-making requires
interdisciplinary collaboration. Addressing societal needs and sustainable water
management goals requires holistic approaches that consider socio-economic and
environmental factors.
