# Theory of biomass decay

The decay of dead biomass is one of the key processes that the `virtual_ecosystem` aims
to capture. Understanding this process is vital to understanding both the long term fate
of carbon in the system and understanding the recycling of nutrients which sustains the
system as a whole.

In the virtual ecosystem, we split biomass decay between two separate models. The
[litter model](./litter_theory.md) handles the breakdown of biomass that's still in an
identifiable form, the [here](./soil_theory.md) then handles the subsequent stages of
decay.

TODO - Write the below out as something nicer.
So basically the reason we split is that litter and soil theory is that there is
significant and consequential uncertainties in terms of the fate of soil organic matter,
with litter is more of a question of timing (though importantly we also allow animals to
eat litter)
