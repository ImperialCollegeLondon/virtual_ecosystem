# Theory of biomass decay

TODO - Need to add this to the sidebar

The decay of dead biomass is one of the key processes that the `virtual_ecosystem` aims
to capture. Understanding this process is vital to understanding both the long term fate
of carbon in the system and understanding the recycling of nutrients which sustains the
system as a whole.

Details of litter decay theory can be found [here](./litter_theory.md), and soil decay
theory can be found [here](./soil_theory.md).

TODO - at the moment I'm just using this page to link to places but it needs to become a
proper overview that links to more detailed pages where relevant.
