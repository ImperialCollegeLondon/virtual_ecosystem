# Microclimate

Many ecosystems have a high spatial variability of microclimates providing
suitable habitats for a diverse range of species. Scales of microclimates typically
range between than 0.1-100 m horizontally, 10-100 m vertically, and seconds to minutes
temporally {cite}`bramer_chapter_2018`.

While microclimates are driven by macroclimatic conditions, the
conditions that organisms experience can deviate substantially from the conditions at
reference height or macroclimatic conditions. For example, the temperature above a
rainforest canopy is typically several degrees higher than near the surface, the surface
under a dense canopy tends to be cooler than unshaded surface spots, and temperatures
generally decrease with elevation.

## Factors affecting microclimate

### Macroclimate / Location

* **Solar radiation**: The latitude and seasonal changes dictated by the macroclimate
determine the amount of solar energy received. Local features like tree cover or
buildings can create microclimatic variations in sunlight exposure.
* **Baseline temperature**: Macroclimate establishes the general temperature range for a
region. Local features can cause variations within this range (e.g., urban heat islands,
shaded areas).
* **Precipitation patterns**: The overall amount and distribution of precipitation are
dictated by macroclimate. Local factors such as topography can modify precipitation
(e.g., rain shadows, increased moisture in valleys).
* **Wind patterns**: Large-scale atmospheric circulation from the macroclimate influences
regional wind patterns. Local topography and urban structures can alter wind flow,
leading to microclimatic differences.
* **Humidity levels**: The macroclimate sets the general humidity level of an area.
Proximity to water bodies, vegetation density, and soil moisture can create localized
variations.
* **Seasonal variations**: Seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar
radiation are governed by the macroclimate. These changes influence local microclimates
differently depending on specific environmental features.

### Topography

* **Elevation**: The height above sea level, which affects temperature, pressure, and
precipitation. Elevation is a key factor in determining climate zones and the
distribution of plant and animal species.
* **Slope and aspect**: The angle and direction of a slope, which influence solar radiation,
wind exposure, and water runoff. Slope and aspect determine microclimatic conditions
such as temperature, moisture availability, and soil erosion.

### Vegetation

* **Leaf Area Index (LAI)**: The leaf area per unit ground area, influencing light
penetration, temperature, and humidity. LAI is an important factor in determining the
productivity and energy balance of an ecosystem.
* **Canopy cover**: The proportion of the ground covered by the vertical projection of tree
crowns, affecting light availability, wind patterns, and temperature. Canopy cover
plays a crucial role in regulating microclimate and providing habitat for wildlife.
* **Plant height**: The height of vegetation, which can influence wind patterns, shading,
and temperature. Taller plants and trees can create microclimates by altering the
flow of air and light.

## Balancing energy, water, and carbon

The dynamics of microclimate in a terrestrical ecosystem in primarily driven by five key
components: radiation balance, energy balance, water balance, carbon balance, and
turbulent transfer (see [Figure x](./abiotic_theory.md)). These components are connected
through the exchange of
energy, water, and carbon and can be described with the general energy balance equation:

$$
R_N & = (1 - \alpha) S_\downarrow + L_\downarrow - \epsilon \sigma (T_{sfc} + 273.15)^4 \\
    & = H + L_{v}E + G + NPP
$$

where $R_N$ is the net radiation at the surface, $\alpha$ is the surface albedo,
$S_\downarrow$ and $L_\downarrow$ are downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation,
respectively. $\epsilon$ is the emissivity of the surface, $\sigma$ is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T_sfc$ is the surface temperature in Celsius.
$H$ is the sensible heat flux, $L_v E$ is the latent heat flux, $G$ is the ground heat
flux, and $NPP$ stands for net primary productivity.

* **Radiation balance**: The radiation balance refers to the equilibrium between incoming
solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation within an ecosystem. How much
radiation is reflected, scattered and absorbed depends on the albedo and structure of
the surface.
* **Energy balance**: The energy balance referes to the equilibrium of absorbed and released
energy at a surface, for example the soil surface or the canopy. This balance is closely
coupled to the radiation balance through net radiation, which is partitioned into
turbulent fluxes (latent, sensble, and ground heat flux), used for photosynthesis, and
changes in heat storage.
* **Water balance**: The water balance refers to the equilibrium of absorbed and released
water by different (here abiotic) ecosystem components. This balance is linked to the
energy balance via evapotranspiration and latent heat flux from the soil surface.
The hydrology on catchment scale is described below in more detail.
* **Carbon balance**: The carbon balance is linked to the above balances through net primary
productivity: the conversion of light, atmospheric carbon, water, (and nutrients) into
biomass minus respiration. The cycle continues as biomass enters the soil and is
eventually recycled to the atmosphere.
* **Turbulent transfer**: The turbulent transfer and wind mix all the properties vertically
and horizontally, leading to ecosystem characteristic patterns and profiles of
microclimatic variables.

## Key microclimatic variables

### Solar Radiation

* **Direct solar radiation**: The sunlight that reaches the surface directly from the sun.
It affects temperature, photosynthesis in plants, and the energy balance of an area.
* **Diffuse solar radiation**: Sunlight scattered by molecules and particles in the
atmosphere that reaches the ground. This type of radiation is essential for plant
growth in shaded or cloudy conditions.
* **Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)**: The portion of sunlight (400-700 nm
wavelength) that plants use for photosynthesis. PAR is critical for plant growth and
development.

### Temperature

* **Air temperature**: The measure of how hot or cold the air is. It is a fundamental
microclimatic variable influencing biological and chemical processes in the
environment.
* **Soil temperature**: The temperature of the soil at various depths, which affects plant
growth, root activity, and microbial activity. Soil temperature can significantly differ
from air temperature due to soil composition and moisture content.
* **Surface temperature**: The temperature of the ground or other surfaces, which can
influence air temperature and humidity levels. Surface temperature is particularly
important in urban areas where materials like concrete and asphalt retain heat.

### Humidity

* **Relative humidity**: The percentage of moisture in the air relative to the maximum
amount the air can hold at that temperature. It impacts human comfort, plant
transpiration, and microbial activity.
* **Vapour pressure deficit (VPD)**: VPD is the difference between the amount of
moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated. It is a
crucial factor in understanding plant transpiration and water stress, as higher VPD
indicates a greater potential for evaporation and transpiration.
* **Soil moisture**: The amount of water contained within soil particles, crucial for
plant health and growth. Soil moisture affects evaporation rates, temperature, and the
availability of water for plants.
* **Soil matric potential** Soil Matric Potential refers to the energy status of water
in soil, representing the force per unit area that the soil matrix exerts on water due
to capillary and adsorptive forces. It influences the movement and availability of water
to plants, with lower values indicating drier conditions and higher values indicating
wetter conditions.

### Wind

* Wind Speed: The rate at which air is moving horizontally. Wind speed influences
temperature regulation, evaporation rates, and the dispersion of pollutants.
* Wind Direction: The direction from which the wind is blowing. It affects microclimate
by influencing temperature distribution, humidity, and the transport of seeds and pollen.
* Turbulence: The irregular, chaotic movement of air that can affect the mixing of
microclimatic elements. Turbulence influences heat exchange, moisture distribution, and
the dispersion of aerosols.

### Precipitation

* Rainfall: The amount of rain that falls in a given area over a specific period.
Rainfall is vital for replenishing water sources and maintaining soil moisture.
* Snowfall: The amount of snow that falls, which can be measured as snow depth or water
equivalent. Snowfall influences temperature regulation, soil moisture, and water supply.
* Dew and Frost: The formation of water droplets or ice crystals on surfaces, which can
affect plant health and soil conditions. Dew and frost are critical in areas where
precipitation is low.

### Atmospheric Pressure

The pressure exerted by the atmosphere at a given point, influencing weather patterns
and microclimatic conditions. Changes in atmospheric pressure can indicate upcoming
weather changes, such as storms or fair weather.

### Atmospheric $\ce{CO_{2}}$

Although atmospheric $\ce{CO_{2}}$ is not a micrclimateic variable , it is closely tied
in the balance of energy throughits critical role in photosynsesis. It should therefore
be considered when studying the dynamics on ecosystems.
