# Pre-session notes for `doctest` and `pytest` introduction

You will need:

## Python requirements

We will be using some Python tools for the session, so you will need to have:

- An installation of Python 3.6 or greater
- The `pytest` package installed using `pip install pytest`.
- The `ipython` package installed, using `pip install ipython`. This isn't _strictly_
  needed but it is an improved command line interface for Python and makes tinkering
  with code very much easier.

You _may_ need to use `pip3` here rather than `pip`.

## Visual Studio Code

It is not completely necessary for everyone to use the same code editor, but VSC has
some great extensions that would be useful to share across the team.

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- The `virtual_rainforest` repository contains a file containing recommended extensions
  for the project. If you do not already have a clone of this, then open a terminal in a
  suitable directory and use:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/virtual_rainforest.git
  ```

- Open VSC and then use File > Open Folder... to open the repository. Two things will
  happen:

  - You will get a warning screen that asks if you **trust the authors of the
    repository**. That is _us_ and you do.
  - It will ask if you want to install the recommended extensions for the repository.
    Again, you do.
