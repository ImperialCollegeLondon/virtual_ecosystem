# Welcome to the Virtual Rainforest

This repository is the home for the development of the Virtual Rainforest. The Virtual
Rainforest is a project to develop a simulation of all of the major processes involved
in a real rainforest including the:

- growth and demographic processes of the primary producers within the forest,
- microclimatic processes within and around the rainforest,
- hydrological processes within the canopy, soil and drainage networks,
- biotic and abiotic processes within the soil, and the
- growth and demography of heterotrophs.

## Project details

This project is funded by a 2021 Distinguished Scientist award from the
[NOMIS Foundation](https://nomisfoundation.ch) to Professor Robert Ewers:
