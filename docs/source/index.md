# Welcome to the Virtual Ecosystem

This repository is the home for the development of the Virtual Ecosystem. The Virtual
Ecosystem is a project to develop a simulation of all of the major processes involved
in a real ecosystem including the:

- growth and demographic processes of the primary producers within the forest,
- microclimatic processes within and around the ecosystem,
- hydrological processes within the canopy, soil and drainage networks,
- biotic and abiotic processes within the soil, and the
- growth and demography of heterotrophs.
