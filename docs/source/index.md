# Welcome to the Virtual Ecosystem

The Virtual Ecosystem is a project to develop a simulation of all of the major processes
involved in a real ecosystem including the:

- growth and demographic processes of the primary producers within the forest,
- microclimatic processes within and around the ecosystem,
- hydrological processes within the canopy, soil and drainage networks,
- biotic and abiotic processes within the soil, and the
- growth and demography of heterotrophs.

The project is open-source and is being developed using the Python programming language.

## What to read next

The project documentation and the underlying code are big, so here are some quick links
to help guide you in finding out more about the Virtual Ecosystem. Are you interested
in:

- Reading more about the [scientific theories](./virtual_ecosystem/theory.md)
  underlying the development of the Virtual Ecosystem.
- Exploring the [big picture workflow](./virtual_ecosystem/implementation.md) of the
  implementation of the Virtual Ecosystem.
- Getting started by [installing the Virtual
  Ecosystem](./using_the_ve/getting_started.md) and running a simple example.
- Moving on to [configuring your own simulation](./using_the_ve/configuration/config.md)
  and [providing new data](./using_the_ve/data/data.md).
- Contributing to the [development](./development/contributing.md) of the Virtual
  Ecosystem.
- Simply taking a look at the code! The project is open source and is developed on the
  [ImperialCollegeLondon/virtual_ecosystem](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/virtual_ecosystem)
  repository on GitHub.
