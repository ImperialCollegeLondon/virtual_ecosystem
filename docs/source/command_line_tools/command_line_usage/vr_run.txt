cl_prompt $ vr_run -h
usage: vr_run [-h] [-m MERGE_FILE_PATH] [--version] [cfg_paths ...]

Configure and run a Virtual Rainforest simulation.

    This program sets up and runs a simulation of the Virtual Rainforest model. At
    present this is incomplete. At the moment a set of configuration files are read in
    based on user supplied paths, these are converted to a single configuration file,
    which is then output for further reference. This combined configuration is then used
    to initialise a set of models.

    The command accepts one or more paths to config files or folders containing config
    files (cfg_paths). The set of config files found in those locations are then
    combined and validated to make sure that they contain a complete and consistent
    configuration for a virtual_rainforest simulation. The resolved complete
    configuration is then written to a single consolidated config file (--merge). If a
    specific location isn't provided via the --merge option, the consolidated file is
    saved in the folder `vr_run` was called in under the name
    `vr_full_model_configuration.toml`.

positional arguments:
  cfg_paths             Paths to config files

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MERGE_FILE_PATH, --merge MERGE_FILE_PATH
                        Path for merged config file.
  --version             show program's version number and exit
