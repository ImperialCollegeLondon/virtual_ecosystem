	abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term (≤15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (
              H
              20
              , height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (
              Ẑ
              *, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing
              Ẑ
              * showed that (
              i
              ) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (
              ii
              ) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (
              Quercus rubra
              ) and mesic (codominance by
              Acer rubrum
              and
              Acer saccharum
              ) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (
              Thuja occidentalis
              ) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g.,
              Fraxinus nigra
              ,
              A. rubrum
              ).},

abstract = {Climate strongly influences ecological patterns and processes at scales ranging from local to global. Studies of ecological responses to climate usually rely on data derived from weather stations, where temperature and humidity may differ substantially from that in the microenvironments in which organisms reside. To help remedy this, we present a model that leverages first principles physics to predict microclimate above, within, and below the canopy in any terrestrial location on earth, made freely available as an R software package. The model can be run in one of two modes. In the first, heat and vapour exchange within and below canopy are modelled as transient processes, thus accounting for fine temporal-resolution changes. In the second, steady-state conditions are assumed, enabling conditions at hourly intervals or longer to be estimated with greater computational efficiency. We validated both modes of the model with empirical below-canopy thermal measurements from several locations globally, resulting in hourly predictions with mean absolute error of 2.77 °C and 2.79 °C for the transient and steady-state modes respectively. Alongside the microclimate model, several functions are provided to assist data assimilation, as well as different parameterizations to capture a variety of habitats, allowing flexible application even when little is known about the study location. The model's modular design in a programming language familiar to ecological researchers provides easy access to the modelling of site-specific climate forcing, in an attempt to more closely unify the fields of micrometeorology and ecology.}
