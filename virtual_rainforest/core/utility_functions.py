"""The ``core.utility_functions`` module contains functions that are used across the
Virtual Rainforest, but which don't have a natural home in a specific module. At the
moment, this module only contains a single function, but it will probably expand in
future. Adding functions here can be a good way to reduce the amount boiler plate code
generated for tasks that are repeated across modules.
