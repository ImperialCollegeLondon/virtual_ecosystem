"""The `abiotic.radiation` module.

The radiation module calculates the radiation balance of the Virtual Rainforest.
The top of canopy net shortwave radiation at a given location depends on

1. extra-terrestrial radiation (affected by the earth's orbit, date, and location),

2. terrestrial radiation (affected by atmospheric composition and clouds),

3. topography (elevation, slope and aspect),

4. surface albedo (vegetation type and fraction of vegetation/bare soil), and

5. emitted longwave radiation.

The preprocessing module takes extra-terrestrial radiation as an input and adjusts for
the effects of topography (slope and aspect). Here, the effects of atmospheric
filtering (elevation-dependent) and cloud cover are added to calculate photosynthetic
photon flux density (PPFD) at the top of the canopy which is a crucial input to the
plant module. The implementation is based on :cite:t:`Davis2017`.

Cloud cover and surface albedo also determine how much of the shortwave radiation that
reaches the top of the canopy is reflected and how much remains to be absorbed via
photosynthesis and re-emitted as longwave radiation by vegetation and forest floor.
Scattering and re-absorption of longwave radiation are not considered at this stage.

The radiation balance is calculated with the radiation_balance() function. At the
moment, this happens at a daily timestep.
