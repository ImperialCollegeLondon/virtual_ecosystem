    This is currently a basic placeholder to define the main interfaces between the

    method. This includes the irradiance absorbed within each canopy layer and reaching
    ground level, which at present is estimated using the first time step of the
    provided photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).

    efficiency given the conditions within canopy layers, and the PPFD at the top of the
    canopy and the canopy layer extinction profile is used to estimate gross primary
