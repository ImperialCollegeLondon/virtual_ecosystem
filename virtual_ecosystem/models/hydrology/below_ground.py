    r"""Calculate vertical water flow through soil column, [mm d-1].

    To calculate the flow of water through unsaturated soil, this function uses the
    Richards equation. First, the function calculates the effective saturation :math:`S`
    and effective hydraulic conductivity :math:`K(S)` based on the moisture content
    :math:`\Theta` using the Mualem-van Genuchten model
    :cite:p:`van_genuchten_closed-form_1980`:

    :math:`S = \frac{\Theta - \Theta_{r}}{\Theta_{s} - \Theta_{r}}`

    and

    :math:`K(S) = K_{s}* \sqrt{S} *(1-(1-S^{1/m})^{m})^{2}`

    where :math:`\Theta_{r}` is the residual moisture content, :math:`\Theta_{s}` is the
    saturated moisture content, :math:`K_{s}` is the saturated hydraulic conductivity,
    and :math:`m=1-1/n` is a shape parameter derived from the non-linearity parameter
    :math:`n`. Then, the function applies Darcy's law to calculate the water flow rate
    :math:`q` in :math:`\frac{m^3}{s^1}` considering the effective hydraulic
    conductivity:

    :math:`q = - K(S)*(\frac{dh}{dl}-1)`

    where :math:`\frac{dh}{dl}` is the hydraulic gradient with :math:`l` the
    length of the flow path in meters (here equal to the soil depth).

    Note that there are severe limitations to this approach on the temporal and
    spatial scale of this model and this can only be treated as a very rough
    approximation!

    Groundwater storage and transport are modelled using two parallel linear reservoirs,
    similar to the approach used in the HBV-96 model
    :cite:p:`lindstrom_development_1997` and the LISFLOOD
    :cite:p:`van_der_knijff_lisflood_2010` (see for full documentation).

    The upper zone represents a quick runoff component, which includes fast groundwater
    and subsurface flow through macro-pores in the soil. The lower zone represents the
    slow groundwater component that generates the base flow.

    The outflow from the upper zone to the channel, :math:`Q_{uz}`, [mm], equals:

    :math:`Q_{uz} = \frac{1}{T_{uz}} * UZ * \Delta t`

    where :math:`T_{uz}` is the reservoir constant for the upper groundwater layer
    [days], and :math:`UZ` is the amount of water that is stored in the upper zone [mm].
    The amount of water stored in the upper zone is computed as follows:

    :math:`UZ = D_{ls,gw} + D_{pref,gw} - D{uz,lz}`

    where :math:`D_{ls,gw}` is the flow from the lower soil layer to groundwater,
    :math:`D_{pref,gw}` is the amount of preferential flow or bypass flow per time step,
    :math:`D_{uz,lz}` is the amount of water that percolates from the upper to the lower
    zone, all in [mm].

    The water percolates from the upper to the lower zone is the inflow to the lower
    groundwater zone. This amount of water is provided by the upper groundwater zone.
    :math:`D_{uz,lz}` is a fixed amount per computational time step and it is defined as
    follows:

    :math:`D_{uz,lz} = min(GW_{perc} * \Delta t, UZ)`

    where :math:`GW_{perc}`, [mm day], is the maximum percolation rate from the upper to
    the lower groundwater zone. The outflow from the lower zone to the channel is then
    computed by:

    :math:`Q_{lz} = \frac{1}{T_{lz}} * LZ * \Delta t`

    :math:`T_{lz}` is the reservoir constant for the lower groundwater layer, [days],
    and :math:`LZ` is the amount of water that is stored in the lower zone, [mm].
    :math:`LZ` is computed as follows:

    :math:`LZ = D_{uz,lz} - (GW_{loss} * \Delta t)`

    where :math:`D_{uz,lz}` is the percolation from the upper groundwater zone,[mm],
    and :math:`GW_{loss}` is the maximum percolation rate from the lower groundwater
    zone, [mm day].

    The amount of water defined by :math:`GW_{loss}` never rejoins the river channel and
    is lost beyond the catchment boundaries or to deep groundwater systems. The larger
    the value of ath:`GW_{loss}`, the larger the amount of water that leaves the system.

        groundwater_storage: amount of water that is stored in the groundwater reservoir
