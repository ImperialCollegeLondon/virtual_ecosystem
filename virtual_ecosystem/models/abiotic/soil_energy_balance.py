r"""The ``models.abiotic.soil_energy_balance`` module calculates the soil energy balance
for the Virtual Ecosystem.

The first part of this module determines the energy balance at the surface.
:func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.soil_energy_balance.calculate_soil_heat_balance`
calculates how incoming solar radiation that reaches the surface is partitioned in
sensible, latent, and ground heat flux. Further, longwave emission is calculated and the
topsoil temperature is updated.

The second part determines the soil temperature profile at different depths. We
divide the soil into discrete layers to numerically solve the time-dependent
differential equation that describes soil temperature as a function of depth
and time (see TODO THIS FUNCTION for details).
