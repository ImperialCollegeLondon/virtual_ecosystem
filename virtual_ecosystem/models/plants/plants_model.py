    """A class defining the plants model.

    This is currently a basic placeholder to define the main interfaces between the
    plants model and other models.

    When a model instance is created, the model attributes are validated and set.
    The initial canopy structure for each grid cell is then generated from provided
    plant cohort data using the
    :meth:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.plants.plants_model.PlantsModel.update_canopy_layers`
    method. This includes the irradiance absorbed within each canopy layer and reaching
    ground level, which at present is estimated using the first time step of the
    provided photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).

    When the model is updated, the P Model **will be** used to calculate the light use
    efficiency given the conditions within canopy layers, and the PPFD at the top of the
    canopy and the canopy layer extinction profile is used to estimate gross primary
    productivity across plant cohorts. An allocation model is then used to estimate
    growth and then update the canopy model.

    Required Variables:

        The following variables must be provided in the ``data`` instance to initialise
        an instance of this model:

        * ``plant_cohorts_cell_id``: The grid cell id containing the cohort
        * ``plant_cohorts_pft``: The plant functional type of the cohort
        * ``plant_cohorts_n``: The number of individuals in the cohort
        * ``plant_cohorts_dbh``: The diameter at breast height of the individuals in
          metres.
        * ``photosynthetic_photon_flux_density``: The above canopy photosynthetic photon
          flux density in Âµmol m-2 s-1.

    Warning:
        The current implementation defines the main interfaces between the plants model
        and other models and accesses and updates the expected data to be used in the
        full model. The actual predictions of the model are placeholder values.
