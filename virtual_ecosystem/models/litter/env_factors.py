    For the above ground layer the impact of temperature is calculated, and for the
    below ground layer the effect of temperature and soil water potential are both
    calculated.

    The relevant above ground temperature is the surface temperature, which can be
    easily extracted from the temperature data. It's more complex for the below ground
    temperature and the water potential as the relevant values are averages across the
    microbially active depth. These are calculated by averaging across the soil layers
    with each layer weighted by the proportion of the total microbially active depth it
    represents.

    If a shallow microbially active depth is used then below ground litter decomposition
    will be exposed to a high degree of environmental variability. This is
    representative of the real world, but needs to be kept in mind when comparing to
    other models.
