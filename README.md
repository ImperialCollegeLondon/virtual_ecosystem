# Welcome to the Virtual Rainforest

This repository is the home for the development of the Virtual Rainforest. The
Virtual Rainforest is a project to develop a simulation of all of the major
processes involved in a real rainforest including the:

* growth and demographic processes of the primary producers within the forest,
* microclimatic processes within and around the rainforest,
* hydrological processes within the canopy, soil and drainage networks,
* biotic and abiotic processes within the soil, and the
* growth and demography of heterotrophs.

## Project details

This project is funded by a 2021 Distinguished Scientist award from the NOMIS
Foundation to Professor Robert Ewers:
